## Introduction
Welcome to KeyStoreConnect! This project provides a robust solution for managing and accessing certificates. It's designed to simplify security management for applications, offering easy integration and high security standards.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 21 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## How to Build
To build the project, use Maven:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
This command cleans any compiled files in your project, ensuring a fresh build from the source.

## How to Build Docker Image
If you prefer Docker, you can build an image using:
```bash
docker build -t lichbalab:cmc-0.0.1 .
```
This command builds a Docker image tagged `lichbalab:ksc-0.0.1`.

## How to Run Docker Image
Run the Docker image with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
To follow the log output:
```bash
docker logs -f <conainer-id>
```
To get <container-id> use:
```bash
docker ps
```

This starts the Docker container in detached mode.

## How to Start

```bash
java -jar target/ksc-rest-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
### Via Maven:
